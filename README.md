## Description

This application allows the user to generate a web page containing information from their team. Such information includes role, email address, Github account (for Engineers), university (for Interns) and office number (for Managers).


## Installation

In order to use this project, make sure to sure 'npm install' to obtain the appropriate npm modules that allow for the execution of the application. Please also make sure to read this entire README.md file for all additional information.

## Usage

To start the execution of the application, type 'node index' or 'node index.js' and the series of prompts will guide you through the process of data collection. Once the last user information has been collected and the user has indicated that no more team members will be added, then "index.html" is generated at the /dist/directory.
